class("It gives me as much pleasure to see you in your place, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as it gives me to be back in the House of Commons. The by-election victors of the last Parliament are slightly depleted in number. I hope that those absent Tory colleagues will come back in good time to continue the service they gave not only in their speeches but in the fact that they were elected in previously Labour seats and thus helped to prevent some of the previous Government\'s worst excesses.\nAs my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton \(Mr. Forman\) said, the Conservative Party\'s intake in this Parliament shows how much of the talent, energy and enthusiasm of people entering politics is predominantly loaded on the Conservative Benches. This is not just because the Conservative approach is always right. If good people are attracted into a political party, it is more likely to reflect the mood, aspirations and ambitions, and provide a way of tapping the energy, of the people of this country.\nIn its post mortem, the Labour Party might try to discover what it can do to get better people to join its ranks—although no doubt many of the Labour Members elected two weeks ago will make a good contribution to our debates.\nI do not want to spend too much time on subjects on which I hope to speak in the months to come, such as trade unions, but perhaps a high spot of the campaign, which led to the present contents of the Gracious Speech, was the Conservative trade union conference at Wembley on the last Sunday of the campaign. It was the largest political meeting of the campaign. It showed that those who claimed that it was only the Labour Party which could speak for trade union members were totally wrong.\nIn the 1974 general elections it was commonly estimated that over 4 million trade union members voted Conservative. At this election, with the Conservative vote going up the way it did, many more trade union members must have voted Conservative. Probably one person in three who votes for the Conservative Party is a trade union member, or married to a trade union member. The Conservatives therefore have as much right to speak for trade unions as have Labour Members.\nI shall not follow the remarks of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley \(Mr. Hooley\) about overseas development, although I have strong views on many of the topics that he raised. Nor do I want to concentrate now on another area of policy which started off as very much my own but from which the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South-East \(Mr. Callaghan\) took parts of the rhetoric if not always the action—that is, family policy. If we could get as much representation of people\'s family or domestic interests as we get for their interests at work, we would have far better politics and probably far better policies for the country.\nFor the sake of those who are considering new initiatives, I suggest that the Government should consider having a family policy review every year, or every two or three years, which will set out the long-term aims of the Government, perhaps over 10, 15 or 20 years, and then say which parts they are willing to attempt in the next 18 months or so. It is a policy that works well in defence matters, and it could just as well be applied to family policy.\nI want to refer to three constituency issues which came out during the election campaign, although they were not strictly party political. I do so because the references in the Gracious Speech to subjects such as health mean a great deal to my constituents.\nWe had threats in the last Parliament against two local hospitals. One threatened the closure of the Memorial hospital, which was built as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the First World War. It is now a fine hospital for the elderly and for out-patients. Its name made it possible for me to ask the Secretary of State in the last Parliament when was the last time his Department had closed down a war memorial. Fortunately the Department of Health and Social Security made it unnecessary for that question to be answered in any great detail, because the Memorial hospital has been saved.\nThe other hospital, the Eltham and Mottingham hospital, which was the subject of a 16,000-signature petition in the previous Parliament, was recommended by the area health authority to remain open, but unfortunately the right hon. Member for Norwich, North \(Mr. Ennals\) confirmed that it should close, although he was apparently reluctant to announce publicly the date of closure, which is supposed to come some time this year. The closure was probably held off because my seat was a marginal one, and to have been too open about such a political decision might have made it possible for my seat to remain in hands other than those of the Labour Party.\nI put a plea to my right hon. Friend the new Secretary of State to review the decision to close the Eltham and Mottingham hospital and to issue a stay of execution for at least two or three months, so that there can be a proper examination of the use of the beds and out-patient facilities, of the question of convenience to local people, of whether convalescent beds should be counted as acute beds or as a separate category and of whether what is seen as an old cottage hospital should now be renamed a community hospital—a growing trend in the National Health Service. The holding of such a review would be right, and I hope that the Department will also get a stay of execution so that we can have the argument without pressure of time.\nOf course, it may be said that keeping the Eltham and Mottingham hospital open involves public expenditure. In my constituency the largest employer on one site is the Defence Codification Authority at Mottingham, where about 300 people work and where the Ministry of Defence has been, and probably still is, planning to move the jobs—not the people, since most of them will not go to Harrogate or Glasgow. I was told towards the end of the last Parliament that the cost of the proposed move was estimated at that time to be £1,750,000. It is intended to spend nearly £2 million to destroy nearly 300 jobs in my constituency and to move them to another constituency, with the consequent dislocation and disruption of important Ministry of Defence work.\nIt is important that those jobs and that work should remain in my constituency, or at least in the borough of Greenwich, which has fine, historic Service connections. If one could hypothecate revenues, the money saved by leaving the jobs in Greenwich could be used to keep open the Eltham and Mottingham hospital. There would be a net saving in public expenditure.\nAnother constituency point on which the local Labour Party now agrees with the campaign that I have been running for five years is the need to build the Rochester Way relief road, which I believe should be renamed the Eltham relief road. It is the missing link between the motorway through the Blackwall tunnel and the motorway-standard road down into Kent. There is a missing three-mile stretch. Many people live by that road, and some have lived there for 40 years—ever since it was little more than a country lane. It now carries as much traffic as any road crossing the London boundary. The traffic has increased because of our membership of the EEC and it is important that the relief road should be built as soon as possible.\nThere will probably be a public inquiry, and I put a plea to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment to ensure that when the inspector reports we do not repeat the failure that followed the public inquiry of 1970, when the inspector\'s report was not issued to the public until six years later, when we discovered that he recommended that the road should not be regarded as part of the \"motorway box\", was urgently needed and should be built at once. That report stayed hidden from the public for six years.\nI support what my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton said about the need for additional information. This is necessary not just to prevent the Government wasting money on projects that should not be built but to ensure that necessary projects are built when they would be cheaper.\nThere are a number of other topics that were important in the campaign. I do not intend to refight the campaign, because there is probably agreement on these matters among the voters for all parties, if not always among the parties themselves.\nThe importance of allowing people to buy their own homes is not just to ensure owner-occupation for its own sake. Owner-occupation has roughly doubled in this country over a certain number of years and it ought to be possible for it to double in my constituency, but if 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of the homes are owned by local councils and are not sold, it will not be possible for owner-occupation to grow in my constituency.\nIt is clearly unfair that owner-occupation should be able to grow in new and developing areas but not in old, established areas. The growth of owner-occupation also makes it possible for people to move when they wish and to share in the ownership of wealth. Any party that says that the ownership of wealth is unfairly distributed yet believes that we should not allow 40 per cent. of my constituents to have any wealth of their own through owner-occupation should think again about the logic of its position.\nThe education division in which my constituency is situated has probably the highest proportion of what are called \"1-1-1s\"—the bright, able children—in inner London, but the allocation system for secondary schools does not take that fact into account. The last children who were withheld from school because their parents strongly disagreed with last year\'s allocation have now been accepted, and I hope that the education authority, with the encouragement of the Department of Education and Science, will make sure that that sort of problem does not arise again and that parental choice is as widespread as possible at the time the children transfer. I hope also that education authorities will be encouraged to ask parents two or three years in advance which schools they are thinking of and why. Obviously parents\' views change and families move, but the reasons for parental preferences are important for education administrators and councillors.\nInstead of concentrating a large number of resources on merging the full CSE and O-level examinations, I hope that the Secretary of State for Education and Science will do two important things. The first is simple—to persuade the CSE and O-level boards to agree that a CSE grade 1 is equivalent to an O-level. This would get rid of the problem—half the case for merging the examinations—that employers and people outside do not know about this equivalence. To be able to state that on the certificate would deal with that part of the problem.\nThe second issue is to deal with those children for whom O-levels are not a realistic target, where perhaps a few CSEs only would be the limit of their capacity. We need to bring in proficiency standards and targets which are relevant to all children in all schools. We have seen them in such organisations as the Scouts and the Boys\' Brigade. A child goes for a particular badge, achieves that and wants to know what the next target is and whether it can be achieved in six weeks or six months. The different times do not matter. Such a system would mean that we would not be saying to a 12-year-old \"Wait until you are 16, four or five years on. and you can take a test which we know 40 per cent. of you will fail.\" Building up confidence and going through education by stages seems to me to be far more important than great effort spent in merging CSEs and O-levels.\nCrime is an important issue. In addition to taking note of the measures announced in the Gracious Speech, I hope that politicians will talk to parents. Half the crime in this country is committed by juveniles. They should be under the control of their parents, and those parents should be encouraged to provide the kind of chaperoning, control or care which makes such a difference to how a child behaves. If a child is exhausted by music, singing, sport or being a member of the Brownies, he or she will spend less time wandering round the streets at night.\nThe last point that I make—besides saying in parenthesis that I agree about Members\' pay—is that our voting system should be changed. I leave the question of proportional representation to another time, but we must allow people to register votes when they are going on holiday. Holidays are not for one party or another. There is a 5 per cent. postal vote for people who are ill or who have jobs which might take them away. Why not have postal votes for those who by chance are going to be on holiday? We should change the registration of voters so that people can more easily re-register in a new constituency or a new address during the year. To have an election on 16 February based on a register of where people lived on 10 October is surely out of date.")
